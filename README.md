## 🧭 Overview
This project was developed as part of the **DataVerse Africa Data Gap Initiative**.  
It leverages **pharmacy sales analytics** to detect counterfeit and substandard drugs in Nigeria.  
By applying data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and **anomaly detection**, it identifies unusual sales patterns such as low pricing, fake brands, and unreliable suppliers—helping regulators and pharmacy chains improve drug safety and monitoring.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Detect suspicious sales patterns** linked to counterfeit medicines.  
- **Identify anomalies** such as unusually low prices or sales spikes.  
- **Evaluate supplier reliability** and pharmacy risk levels.  
- **Provide insights and dashboards** for decision-making support.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Python** | Data cleaning, preprocessing, and anomaly detection |
| **SQL** | Data extraction and structuring |
| **Tableau** | Interactive dashboards and data visualization |
| **pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn** | Data manipulation, EDA, and modeling |

## 📊 Data Insights
- **Total Transactions:** 10000  
- **Total Revenue:** ₦1,326,670,603.18
- **Average Transaction Value:** ₦133,239.99 

### 🔍 Key Findings
- Pharmacies with **significantly lower prices** often indicate counterfeit activity.  
- **Urban and rural pharmacies** both contribute substantially to fake drug circulation.  
- Top-selling drugs such as **Amoxicillin**, **Coartem**, and **Ciprofloxacin** require close monitoring.  

---

## 🧩 Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered pharmacy sales data from urban and rural sources.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned missing values, engineered new features (e.g., price per unit, days to expiry).  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examined trends in sales, pricing, and brand diversity.  
4. **Anomaly Detection:** Used ML algorithms to identify suspicious patterns and assign risk scores.  
5. **Visualization:** Built Tableau dashboards to display insights and risk summaries.  

---

## 💡 Recommendations
### Short-term
- Deploy dashboards for **real-time anomaly monitoring**.  
- Conduct **targeted inspections** of flagged pharmacies and suppliers.  
- Launch **public awareness campaigns** about counterfeit drug dangers.  

### Long-term
- Establish **data-sharing frameworks** between pharmacies, suppliers, and regulators.  
- Integrate **blockchain** for supply chain transparency.  
- Train **regulatory officers** in data-driven surveillance.  
- Enforce **stricter penalties** for counterfeit drug distribution.
